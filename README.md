# Ublock Filters

Why? I was not happy with the unsorted mess my custom filters became over time.
The idea is to have filter lists that are not only site-specific, but more topic-specific, or at least smaller/modular.
That way they are easier to test/debug and can be deactivated selectively if something breaks.

- [reddit.com-antiblur.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inktrap/ublock-filters/refs/heads/main/reddit.com-antiblur.txt) removes blur and some engagement stuff (prompts to comment/log-in/â€¦) also on mobile
- [imgur.com-engagement.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inktrap/ublock-filters/refs/heads/main/imgur.com-engagement.txt) as the name suggests, also on mobile
